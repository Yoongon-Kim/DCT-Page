To stabilize the currency, a combination of tight fiscal policies and tax reforms would be required, along with banking sector consolidation. This approach helps to address the immediate liquidity issues and strengthens the financial system's resilience. Additionally, while attempting to maintain the pegged exchange rate, utilizing external reserves and increasing sterilization efforts can help in the short term, but this approach may strain reserves in the long run, limiting the flexibility and responsiveness of the economy to market conditions.
