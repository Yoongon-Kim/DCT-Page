To stabilize the currency, a combination of tight fiscal policies and tax reforms would be required, along with banking sector consolidation. Additionally, while attempting to maintain the peg by utilizing external reserves and increasing sterilization efforts, this approach may strain reserves in the long run, limiting flexibility and responsiveness to market conditions. Therefore, measures such as capital controls and reducing short-term debt could help mitigate the potential effects on economic stability.", "input_len": 120000, "effective_len": 4289}
